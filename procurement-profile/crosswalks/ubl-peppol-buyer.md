# Crosswalk — `buyer` to UBL `cac:Party` / OCDS `parties` / eForms

## Status

Probe (2026-05-08). Third per-fragment crosswalk under the ADR 0034
layered-on-UBL discipline; companion to the opportunity crosswalk.
Authored as the Opportunity probe identified the Buyer crosswalk as the
"second-most-load-bearing UBL crosswalk after this one." Pinned to:

- UBL 2.3 — `cac:Party` (with `cac:ContractingParty`,
  `cac:PartyName`, `cac:PartyIdentification`, `cac:PostalAddress`,
  `cac:PartyLegalEntity`, `cac:Contact`).
- OCDS 1.1.5 — `parties[]` array with `roles[]`, `identifier`,
  `additionalIdentifiers[]`, `name`, `address`, `contactPoint`,
  `details`.
- EU eForms — Buyer party identifier (BT-500 series) and Contracting
  Authority identification (BT-505 family).

Re-pin trigger is event-driven per ADR 0034 §2.

Sources:

- UBL 2.3 `cac:Party` — https://www.datypic.com/sc/ubl23/e-cac_Party.html
- OCDS `parties` — https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/schema/reference/

## Bottom line

**GREEN.** Mapping is feasible. The current canonical `Buyer` (9
columns at `packages/db/src/schema/index.ts:126`) is a small,
intentionally lean entity; UBL `cac:Party` is much richer (23 child
elements). The ratio inverts the previous crosswalks: instead of
"how do we map our rich shape to UBL," it's "how much of UBL do we
absorb into our canonical Buyer." Across the 10 rows of the table below
(the existing canonical columns plus the two additions) the distribution
is **3 exact / 4 partial / 0 novel / 3 platform-internal**. All 7
procurement-meaningful fields map to UBL, exactly or partially; none is
novel. The
relevant question is which of the ~14 UBL/OCDS Party fields we **don't**
have are worth promoting to canonical Buyer columns vs. leaving in the
`fields` spillover or a future side-table.

**Recommendation: ship the canonical `Buyer` mostly as-is, with two
small additions** to close obvious gaps for the layered-on-UBL emit
path: a stable `legalIdentifier` (UBL `cac:PartyIdentification` /
OCDS `identifier.id`), and a structured `address` extension (UBL
`cac:PostalAddress` / OCDS `address`). Both are nullable; existing
rows remain unchanged.

## Existing canonical `Buyer` shape

```ts
{
  id: uuid;                    // platform-internal
  canonicalName: text;         // primary display name
  buyerType: text;             // 'federal_agency' | 'state_authority' | 'enterprise' | ...
  regime: text;                // 'us_federal' | 'uk_public' | 'eu_oj' | 'enterprise' | ...
  parentBuyerId: uuid | null;  // self-referencing for sub-agency hierarchy
  countryCode: text | null;    // ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
  regionCode: text | null;     // ISO 3166-2 (sub-national)
  sourceConfidence: numeric;   // platform-internal
  createdAt, updatedAt: timestamptz;
}
```

Unique on `(canonicalName, regime)`.

## Proposed two additions

```ts
{
  // ... existing 9 columns ...
  legalIdentifier: text | null; // UBL cac:PartyIdentification/cbc:ID, OCDS identifier.id
  legalIdentifierScheme: text | null; // UBL listID, OCDS identifier.scheme — e.g. 'GLN' | 'DUNS' | 'EU-VAT' | 'US-DUNS' | 'US-CAGE' | 'US-UEI'
}
```

The structured address belongs on a separate `buyer_address` extension
table (1:N for buyers with multiple offices); see the §Future
follow-ons section. Adding it to canonical `buyer` directly would
collapse the multi-office case the moment a buyer has more than one
contracting office.

## Open questions to resolve

1. **Should `legalIdentifier` be unique on the buyer table?** A buyer
   with a known DUNS / EU-VAT / UEI is uniquely identified by that
   number across regimes; allowing duplicates is a data-quality
   problem. But not every buyer carries a stable identifier (small
   municipalities often don't), so a hard uniqueness constraint
   conflicts with NULL-tolerant ingestion.
   - **(A)** Add a partial unique index on `(legalIdentifier,
legalIdentifierScheme)` WHERE `legalIdentifier IS NOT NULL`.
     Strong data quality; tolerates NULLs.
   - **(B)** No uniqueness; rely on application-level deduplication.
     Simpler; weaker quality.
   - **Recommendation: (A).** Same shape as the
     `(canonicalName, regime)` unique constraint already on the table;
     the partial index covers the NULL case cleanly.

2. **Multi-office buyers — promote `buyer_address` now or defer?**
   The opportunity probe noted that finer geographic detail flows
   through `opportunity_source_metadata`. But buyer-side addresses
   (the contracting authority's mailing address) live nowhere
   structured today.
   - **(A)** Add a `buyer_address` extension table now (1:N), with
     `kind` ('headquarters' | 'mailing' | 'invoicing' | 'physical')
     and structured fields (`street`, `city`, `postalCode`,
     `regionCode`, `countryCode`).
   - **(B)** Defer until a downstream surface needs structured buyer
     address; today it can live in `fields` spillover for adapters
     that ingest UBL.
   - **Recommendation: (B).** No current downstream consumer demands
     structured buyer address (the canonical row's `countryCode` /
     `regionCode` already covers the geographic-routing use case).
     Promote when the consumer lands.

3. **Tenant-scoped buyer overrides — out of scope or surface here?**
   Some tenants want to record their own canonical name for a buyer
   that disagrees with the platform's (e.g. "we always call Department
   of X 'DoX'"). Today no such surface exists.
   - **(A)** Add a `tenant_buyer_alias` table now.
   - **(B)** Defer entirely; this is a UI / display-layer concern
     downstream of the canonical row.
   - **Recommendation: (B).** Tenant-scoped display preferences are
     downstream of the canonical model and should not pollute the
     shared-market `buyer` table. Closes per ADR 0005's shared / tenant
     boundary.

## What this probe says about the rest of the work

- The Buyer crosswalk is the smallest of the per-fragment crosswalks
  authored to date — most of UBL `cac:Party`'s 23 child elements are
  deliberately out of scope for the procurement-discovery use case
  this platform serves.
- The two-column addition (`legalIdentifier` +
  `legalIdentifierScheme`) is the only schema change recommended; the
  rest of UBL Party richness lives in `fields` or future side-tables.
- The Party crosswalk applies symmetrically to the **supplier** side
  too (capability_claim's `subjectParty`, ADR 0025); the supplier
  crosswalk reuses the same `cac:Party` mapping and inherits this
  document's UBL element coverage.

| 1   | Migration `0045_buyer_legal_identifier.sql` — adds `legal_identifier` + `legal_identifier_scheme` columns to `buyer`, with partial unique index on `(legal_identifier, legal_identifier_scheme)` WHERE NOT NULL (Q1=A).                                                                                                                                                                        | **shipped** (2026-05-08) |
| 2   | Updated `packages/domain/src/types/opportunity.ts` (the `Buyer` interface) and `packages/db/src/schema/index.ts` (the `buyer` pgTable) to expose the new columns. Also extended the `buyerRef` structure on `CanonicalOpportunityFragment` (`packages/structured-rfx-adapters/src/contract.ts`) so adapters can pass the legal identifier through to the orchestrator's buyer-resolution step. | **shipped** (2026-05-08) |
| 3   | Slice 71 (SAM.gov UEI / CAGE → `legalIdentifierScheme = 'US-UEI'` / `'US-CAGE'`) and slice 73 (Ariba ANID → `'Ariba-ANID'`) doc references added. Slice 79 (OCDS) inherits via the documented `parties[].identifier` mapping in this crosswalk; explicit slice-79 reference deferred until that slice surfaces concrete OCDS adapters.                                                         | **shipped** (2026-05-08) |

## Future follow-ons (not in this probe's scope)

- Buyer-side `buyer_address` extension table (Q2=B, deferred).
- Tenant-scoped buyer alias surface (Q3=B, deferred).
- Buyer-type cross-map (eForms BT-508 codelist ↔ canonical `buyerType`).
- Supplier-side reuse of the Party crosswalk for `capability_claim.subjectParty`.

## Out of scope for this probe

- Supplier-side party (ADR 0025 `capability_claim.subjectParty` ↔
  UBL `cac:Party`). The same crosswalk applies but the consumer set is
  different; document that in a separate artifact when slice 85's
  buyer-facing read of the supplier graph activates.
- `cac:Contact` / `cac:Person` mapping — handled by
  `opportunity_source_metadata` `point_of_contact` per slice 71.
- Round-trip CI test against an EU eForms F02 buyer party fixture.
